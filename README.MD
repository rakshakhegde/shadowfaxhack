**Problem #1 (LOL):** Android app for Riders. Solves the Shadowfax's Clients' orders demand-visibility to the Riders by providing an Android app to the Riders with a Heatmap. This eliminates the people required from Shadowfax to call individual Riders telling them to move to hotspot areas manually. Instead, now, the Riders have the choice to decide where to hangout.

**Problem #4 (LE):** Web portal for Customers. Customers can track Rider's location using the unique link in their SMS. Simultaneously Customer's pinpoint location is relayed to the Rider.

**Problem #3 (POTS):** Web portal for Customers. The customer can 'Pay Online' in the Rider Tracking website if they do not have the required cash if COD was chosen earlier.
