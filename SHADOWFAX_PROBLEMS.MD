## SHADOWFAX PROBLEM STATEMENTS
# Lots of Locations (LOL)
Real-time locations of our delivery executives is a key to manage and optimise most of our products & services. As the location data comes in, it helps in order allocation, route management and many more things. Although we have thought of lots of ways to use them, we have not thought of all of them.

We invite innovative numbers and patterns that can be found from them. How can we use such data to improve logistical solutions to make deliveries faster and help utilise our capacity to the full?

The participants will be given a dump of our delivery executives' real-time location as a file from one of our peak hour periods and some orders that came along in that period. We expect to be shown that data like it has never been shown before.

# Payment on the Spot (POTS)
Almost 95% of consumer deliveries are paid with cash on delivery. Sometimes the consumer has ordered something with COD but does not have cash at the time of delivery. Also, partnering with a logistics partner leaves the merchant with tedious reconciliations at week or month end that may bring capital crunch for not-so- big merchants. To solve this, the solution is to bring real-time payment transfer from customer to merchant. Create an app that takes payments for an order from the customer through cash or online (CC/DC/Net-Banking/Wallet) and dynamically moves the funds digitally to the merchant as soon as possible.

# Game of Deliveries (GOD)
What could be better than making the delivery process for a delivery executive fast and easy? Make it interesting. Create ways for the delivery executive app to monitor the delivery executive behaviour while the order is in its lifecycle, like the routes it took for the order, the actual delivery time against expected delivery time, the shift adherence, over-time etc. Think of ways the app can monitor the user, like the Big Brother and let the delivery executives compete with each other in a battle to become The Ultimate Rider (Delivery executive). Attach rewards with the points they accumulate.

# Location Exchange (LE)
No one has ever been everywhere. When customers tell their delivery address to the merchant, it may not always be coherent enough to reduce to a location on the map for the delivery executive to reach to. Create a way for the delivery executive to exchange his/her location with the customer by sending real-time location of the delivery executive and in exchange get the customer's location. A win-win situation. Keep in mind that the customer cannot game with the delivery executive.
